"""The SINGLE source of truth for the /coach wire contract (Plan 01 Task 2).

This module defines the FULL, FINAL, enlarged non-PII request DTO `TutorFactsIn` and the
response DTO `CoachOut`. It is deployed enlarged from day one. Plans 02/03/04 reference
THIS definition — they do not redefine or widen it.

Why enlarged now: per CAPABLE-AGENT-SPEC, the tutor reasons over the attempt *trajectory*
plus the session learner model (strengths AND struggles), not just the last `mistakeId`.
The minimal one-node graph (this plan) ignores `trajectory`/`strengthTags`; Plan 02's
analyze node consumes them. But the DEPLOYED DTO is already the final contract so the live
/coach never 422s a legit enlarged client payload once Plan 03 enlarges the client type.

`extra="forbid"` on BOTH `TutorFactsIn` and the nested `AttemptFactIn` means any unexpected
field — a leaked stroke/PII key (`strokes`, `x`, `y`, `childName`, `nickname`, …) — is a 422,
never silently accepted. This is the server side of the GROUND-02 non-PII guard.

Field names mirror the client whitelist in `lib/tutor/tutor_facts.dart` (the 6 base fields);
Plan 03 enlarges the client type to add `trajectory` + `strengthTags` to match this DTO.
Tool names mirror `lib/tutor/tutor_decision.dart` (`TutorTool`).
